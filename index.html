        <h1>My Portfolio👝</h1>
        <p>Hello, Timmy here😅,
        a two-time startup founder and experienced product manager. I'm new to front-end development and that's why I joined
        this internship. I currently don't have a portfolio, but I'm confident in my ability to handle any task given to me.
        If it helps, I got a perfect score of 100 in my stage 1 task😎.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My experience in product management has helped me understand user needs and translate them into clear design
        requirements. You can trust me to implement your designs💪🏾.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thank you❤</p>
